        <p>Hi, I'm Ryan and welcome to my website. With a background in chemical and solution engineering and a strong foundation in wet-lab neuroscience surrounding microglia and macrophage cells, I have always been interested in the intersection between neuroscience and engineering. Currently, I am exploring the potential of AI technology to further our understanding of the field. By utilizing ChatGPT, an advanced language model, I hope to simulate the importance of AI in learning and demonstrate how this can be applied to research in all fields, including neuroscience.

In addition to my research, I have a few hobbies that keep me busy in my free time. I'm an avid tennis and disc golf player, and I enjoy hiking and playing the piano. I also make sure to keep up with the latest developments in neuroscience research, as I believe that staying informed is key to pushing the field forward.</p>
