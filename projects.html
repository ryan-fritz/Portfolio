            <h3>Neuroscience Research Internship</h3>
            <p>
              Conducted research in a neuroscience lab to gain hands-on experience in wet-lab neuroscience, specifically studying the effects of microglia and macrophage cells on neurological diseases.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Neuroengineering Project</h3>
            <p>
              Worked on a team to design and develop a neural implant device that can record neural activity and send signals to the brain to mitigate the effects of Parkinson's disease.
